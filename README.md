# Local File-Based Index Search Engine

This project involves the development of an efficient search engine for files stored locally on your computer. By leveraging Java and SQL, the engine indexes and searches both the file metadata and content, providing quick and reliable results.

## Key Features:

### 1. **Java-based Backend**
   - Built the core search functionality in **Java**, utilizing object-oriented principles to structure the indexing and searching logic.
   - Ensured a modular, maintainable, and efficient design for scalability and performance.

### 2. **SQL Database Integration**
   - Integrated an **SQL database** to store key file metadata, including file names, paths, sizes, and indexed content.
   - Optimized the database schema for quick and efficient querying.

### 3. **Custom Indexing System**
   - Developed a robust **indexing mechanism** that scans both file names and contents to create a searchable index.
   - Enabled efficient full-text search, improving search speed and accuracy across large datasets.

### 4. **Efficient Search Functionality**
   - Implemented fast search algorithms that leverage the indexed data to return results quickly.
   - Supported advanced search features such as keyword-based queries and partial matches.
